# How I made it:

Minecraft uses this unique way of implementing on-screen images. You may have seen things like chat emojis implemented into text plugins in-game and in some game servers,
but they could also be used in the action bar. I abused a feature that made any image able to be stretched across the screen, and instead of using the chat the display it,
I used something that could change at a fast rate in order to play the images fast on a player's screen. Then I hand-made the images taking inspiration from scary faces online, and making it
into something indistinguishable compared to an analog-horror-styled entity. It replicates the look of a human face, but the lack of emotion, weird proportions, and extremely
high contrast of the colors make it extremely disturbing to look at, especially when the animation of the collage of images is suddenly revealed on your screen at a
fast pace.

This animation was then animated using tick wait times and making sure the action bar was spammed with enough pngs before it was able to fade away. I also had to create special characters
with negative spacing, up spacing, and other things to keep the images from scaling in different directions


# For quality of development purposes, I finished it off with a "Back to the lobby" option for any theoretical lobby queue this fake game would have.(no actual lobby since this was a concept
design)

# The character

I wanted to embody the humanoid but convey the feeling of having unrecognizable bodily features and have a lack emotion in facial expression. The proportions of the entity must make the player
feel like the entity is big, strong, and somewhat creepy in order for them to assume that they are in danger when ever they see it.
